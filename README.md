# Optuna

*Optuna* is an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework, particularly designed
for machine learning. It features an imperative, *define-by-run* style user API. Thanks to our
*define-by-run* API, the code written with Optuna enjoys high modularity, and the user of
Optuna can dynamically construct the search spaces for the hyperparameters.
